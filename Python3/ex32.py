# same as above

# also we can go through mixed lists too
# notice we have to use %r since we don't know what's in it

# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range function to generate a list
elements = range(0, 6)
    
# now we can print them out too
for i in elements:
    print("Element was: %d" % i)
